<Img src="flyTizzieShot" alt="game screen shot" />

A web game that's generated using artwork painted by users. Made as part of
[SOURCE <span></span>](https://signalfilmandmedia.com/source/)— the Cumbrian
Artist Digital Development Lab from
[Signal Film & Media <span></span>](https://signalfilmandmedia.com/)for the
[Windermere Jetty Museum <span></span>](https://lakelandarts.org.uk/windermere-jetty-museum/).

In the game you’ll play a Tizzie Whizie skimming over Windermere dodging boats,
islands and legends to collect as many stories as you can.

My goal is to introduce the boats and stories of Windermere in a way that’s more
palatable for those who’ll play on their phone rather than read the information
boards in museums.

Primarily aimed at families and kids, I want to offer the chance to move from
the trance-like consumption of mobile gaming to being creative and experimental
with games.

## How it works for users

## How it works behind the scenes

The remit from the Museum was to create something that works solely online. To
do this I’ll be using a range of digital elements, many of which are completely
new to me, but are all areas I’ve been keen to get to grips with for a while.

- I’ll base my game on
  [Google’s offline dinosaur game<span></span>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-play-the-no-internet-google-chrome-dinosaur-game-both-online-and-offline/)
  - I’ve researched various online game engines, but they all seem too heavy
    duty for my needs so I’m going to make my own system for moving, point
    scoring etc.
- The printable sheets are based on things called spritesheets (aka
  [Texture Atlases <span></span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas))
  which are used in lots of games.
  - They are single images containing all the artwork from a game.
  - Along with the image there’s a data file containing the locations of each
    part of the game. E.g. Cloud: x=10, y=20, width:100, height: 50.
  - I’ll use this technique to pick out all the game elements from the
    photographed artwork.
- For the progress bar I’m going to try a
  [SVG line animation<span></span>](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/)
  - SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) can be modified simply with code.
  - I’ve used SVG graphics before, but I wanted to use a technique I’ve seen
    where you can animate a line within the graphic.
  - I’ll use this to represent the game progress as a path along a map of
    Windermere.
- To grab the game sheet from a photo I’ll use things called
  [Aruco markers<span></span>](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html)
  - These are markers that can be picked out from an image by analysing the
    pixel.
  - These markers are more commonly used in Augmented Reality applications, but
    I’ll be using them to pick out the sheet from a user’s photo.
- I’ll use a [WebGL Canvas <span></span>](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/)or
  more spefically an image effect library called
  [GLFX.js <span></span>](https://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/demo/#perspective)to
  straighten out images
  - It’s very unlikely a user will be able to take a photo that’s completely
    perpendicular to their artwork.
  - WebGL is frequently used for speedy online 3D graphics, but I’ll just be
    using it to remove any tilt/perspective. This is probably the trickiest part
    of the project.
- I’ll also be using things I’ve used before to make the site:
  [React <span></span>](https://reactjs.org/),
  [Node <span></span>](https://nodejs.org/),
  [Git <span></span>](https://git-scm.com/),
  [Github <span></span>](https://github.com/),
  [Netlify<span></span>](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Notes for future me

#### Sketchy buttons etc:

I made them using a free SVG Editor called
[Inkscape <span></span>](https://inkscape.org/)and got the files ready for the
site using an optimiser called
[SVGOMG <span></span>](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)and a SVG to
React Component widget called [SVG2JSX<span></span>](https://svg2jsx.com/)

#### Using Sound

This sound library made programming the sounds simple:
